# TaskManagement



Backend (Java):
Task API:
Create a RESTful API using Java (Spring Boot, if preferred) for managing tasks.
Implement endpoints for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for tasks.
Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
Include validation for input data and handle potential errors gracefully.
Database Integration:
Use a relational database (such as MySQL) to store task information.
Design and implement the necessary tables and relationships for storing tasks.
Connect the backend API to the database to perform CRUD operations.
Security:
Implement basic authentication or authorization mechanisms for API endpoints.
Ensure that endpoints are protected from unauthorized access.
